                            <h3>Puerto Vallarta, Mexico</h3>
                            <p>A very energetic and alive port city. The lanscape allows the best of any leisure activities. Hiking, 
                                ziplining, snorking, and so much more.</p>

                            <h3>Ocho Rios, Jamaica</h3>
                            <p>I spent one week in this tropical paradise for my friends Paul and Emily's wedding. It was 
                                hard to leave the endless supply of booze and gourmet cuisine.</p>

                            <h3>Costa Rica</h3>
                            <p>This was a trip of a life time. Three close friends and myself rented a car 
                                and traversed the country for a 10 day adventure. We started our trip trekking 
                                up to Monteverde, where we explored the sky bridges and trails of the cloud forest.
                                We then jumped to La Fortuna, endulging in ziplines and lake Arenal. Unfortnately, 
                                we encountered a down pour on the next leg of our travels, that washed the roads out 
                                perventing us from exploring the Irazu Volcano. So, we moved on to the Caribbean coastal 
                                town of Puerto Viejo. This coastal town is a top destination for Ex-Pats.</p>

                            <h3>Columbia River Gorge, OR</h3>
                            <p>I spent four days hiking multiple trails in the Columbia River Gorge. It was one of the most 
                                majestic places I have ever seen</p>

                            <p>I spent only one day here when I was fourteen, but layed the foundation for my desire to travel.</p>

                            <h3>New Orleans, LA</h3>
                            <p>I have visited NOLA multiple times, and each time it steals a little more of my soul. The grittiness 
                                and pulse of the city are so seductive.</p>

                            <h3>Atlanta, GA</h3>
                            <p>The ATL, another city I have made repeat visits. My brother from another mother lives in Atlanta, and 
                                is the main reason I keep going back.</p>

                            <h3>Sedona, AZ</h3>
                                <p>Very few places emit an energy like Sedona does. It's difficult to describe. There is a force that 
                                    naturally energizes your soul. The Red rock, the lush greenry, and endless sky create an amaing sight.</p>
